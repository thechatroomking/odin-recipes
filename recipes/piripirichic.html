    <p class="description">Serve up an easy one-pan traybake of piri-piri chicken with sweet potatoes and broccoli. As well as being simple to make, it delivers three of your 5-a-day</p>

    <p class="description">Serves 2 adults, 2 children</p>

    <h3 class="choice">Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>

        <li>3 large sweet potatoes (about 900g), peeled and cut into large chunks</li>
        
        <li>oil, for drizzling</li>

        <li>6-8 chicken thighs, skin left on</li>

        <li>2 red onions, cut into wedges</li>
        
        <li>25g sachet piri-piri spice mix (or a mild version, if you like)</li>

        <li>300g long-stem broccoli</li>

    </ul>

    <h3 class="choice">Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Toss the sweet potatoes with a generous drizzle of oil and some seasoning, and tip into a very large roasting tin. Push the potatoes to one end of the tin, then, in the other end, toss the chicken with the onions, spice mix, a drizzle of oil and some seasoning. Roast for 40 mins, stirring everything halfway through. Add the broccoli to the tin, drizzle with a little oil and season, then roast for 10-15 mins more.</li>

        <li>Remove the chicken, onions and broccoli from the tin. Roughly mash the potatoes using a fork, making sure you incorporate all the chicken juices and spices from the pan.</li>

        <li>Spread the mash over the base of the tin, then top with the broccoli, chicken and onions and serve from the tin in the middle of the table.</li>
